# D&D Ability Score Generator
A simple prorgram that generates 6 ability scores to use for character creation in Dungeons and Dragons.

## Getting Started
This program only contains a single file, abilityscores.py. To run, just use:

```
python3 abilityscores.py
```

The output will be a list of 6 ability scores based on the Player's Handbook instructions for generating scores. (That is, roll 4d6, add the highest 3 values, and do the same thing 5 more times to create a total of 6 numbers to be used for ability scores.)
